/// Configuration ///

Two config files are used while setting up the Enimga
-model.ini defines model characteristics
-config.ini sets up user defined configurations
	-This will have 2 sections
		-The default section will be used if the user does not specify a configuration
		-The default configuration will be overwriten if settings are specified in the commandline
		-The user can also call predefined configurations from the commandline
-The commandline should allow explicit input or from a file (same goes for output)


/// Parsing ///

-All data will be passed as integers, converted from characters as input and back to characters as output
-Rotor, and Plugboard classes will needed to have a charToint method to read in initial settings based on 

-Need to find a package/library for facitlitating commandline interface

-Need to write backend for parsing files and text input 
	-dealing with case
	-dealing with invalid characters (user setting)
	-deeling with spaces

/// Testing ///

-Write a test for each class
-Write a test for the enigma as a hole



// Pluboard to-add ///



// HUGE NOTE //

The output of any given rotor is its letter + how much it has been offset!!!
